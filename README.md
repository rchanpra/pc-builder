# PC Builder

Our project is a PC parts picker that assists users in building a custom PC. The domain of our project is custom PC building/computer hardware management/shopping assistant. The database will provide functionality that allows users to search, filter, and select computer hardware components for custom PC builds based on specific criteria, ensure component compatibility checks, and allow users to comment on each product with availability from various retailers.
